Gravity boots - just change time scale of game to .5
WallJump - set a varaible somewhere that allows the walljump inside the cat
WallClaws - set a variable somewhere that allows the wallClaws (wallClaws are on the way down, walljump only on the way up
Parachute - set a variable in the cat that enables the parachute when in free fall (not touching wall too to prevent issues with the two above)
Star To Life Converter - set a variable in ... maybe it needs an item variable script
DrillMode - This doesn't work with the othe wall stuff but we could make it work if we set a speed threshold
RubberWall - just change the wall material on pickup and switch it out again on drop
RubberBoots - change the platform material on pickup and switch it out again on drop
